# What is regression
 Regression is a statisticalmodeling technique that aims to establish a relationship between a dependent variable 
 (also known as the target or outcome variable) and one or more independent variables (also known as predictors or features). 
 The goal of regression analysis is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the given independent variables.

 # Types of Regression Algorithms:
 
 ## LinearRegression:
 Linear regression is the simplest and most commonly used regression algorithm.
 It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.
 The algorithm calculates the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values.
 Linear regression can be further categorized into simple linear regression 
 (with one independent variable) and multiple linear regression (with multiple independent variables).

 ## PolynomialRegression:
 Polynomial regression extends linear regression by introducing polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships between variables. 
 It fits a curve rather than a straight line to the data points, allowing for more flexible modeling.

 ## RidgeRegression:
 Ridge regression is a regularization technique used when dealing with multicollinearity (high correlation among independent variables).
 It adds a penalty term to the linear regression objective function, controlling the model's complexity and reducing overfitting.

 ## LassoRegression:
 Similar to ridge regression, lasso regression also addresses multicollinearity. 
 However, it uses the L1 regularization technique, which tends to produce sparse models by shrinking some coefficients to zero.
 This feature makes lasso regression useful for feature selection.

 ## DecisionTree Regression:
 Decision tree regression builds a decision tree by recursively splitting the data based on the independent variables. 
 Each leaf node represents a predicted outcome value. 
 Decision tree regression is advantageous in handling non-linear relationships and capturing interactions between variables.

 ## RandomForest Regression:
 Random forest regression combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.
 It creates an ensemble of decision trees and aggregates their predictions, resulting in more accurate and robust models.
