Faust – The Tragedy Part One« is a drama by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
It is the most important work of German literature. Goethe describes the restless striving for knowledge and the never-satiated desire of a person who
is dissatisfied with his life. To satisfy his thirst for knowledge and lust, Faust devotes himself to the devil and destroys the life of an innocent girl.
