## Welcome to Tech Expert Academy

### Why

While companies are desperately looking for tech talent, many people are either unemployed or they work in unfullfilling jobs. We want to be the match maker between these two parties. 

### How

We partner with fast growing companies. By knowing their needs in the near future, we know how to best prepare our students to fill these roles. 

### What

At TEA students take a three months intensive training for careers such as Data Engineering, Cloud Solutions etc. They learn at their own pace and have a personal coach checking in with them each week. After the three months period is over, coaches and mentors help to land a job. The classes are free and will be paid back through income share agreements if the student successfully lands a job.
