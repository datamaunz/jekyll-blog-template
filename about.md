## Welcome to My Tech blog

### What i do
Hi, thank you for visiting my page, my name is Richard kilea and i am a data scientist from Tech Expert Academy. I started by learning
python, which is a broad programming language. At first it was challenging but as soon as i stared working on some projects, i started getting more familiar to it.

With my knowledge on Python i advanced and  started learning about some of the libraries used in machine learning such as numpy, matplotlib and Pandas. This libraries are used to do explore, extract, visualize and intepret your data. This libraries are used for structured data.

 After doing some data exploratory moved to using machine learning algorithims to find patterns in my data and do predictions on unseen data. i worked on projects such as heart disease predictions, house prices predictions from kaggle and got scores above 0.8. it was exciting as a beginner!!!!
 
I also got training on deep learning and numerical computing libraries such as Tesor flow. I worked on a project named "Dog Breed Identification" from Kaggle. With Tensor Flow i was able to do the project.

Thank you for taking time and going through my blog. I hope you enjoyed the article. Lets meet next for another article.
